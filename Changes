Revision history for Array-AsHash

0.30    2006-03-02
        Added key_at() and value_at() methods.
        Minor documentation fixes.

0.21    2005-10-15
        Iterator is now object blessed into its own class.  This allows us
        to call "first" and "last" methods directly on the object.

0.20    2005-10-15
        "strict' mode added.  Using non-existent keys is fatal.
        "strict" method also added.
        Reorganized the docs to be a bit cleaner.

0.12    Not released (these are all in 0.20, though)
        "put" can now accept an even-sized list of pairs.
        "get" can now take a list of keys.
        Did a bit of an internals cleanup.
        each() now returns an iterator in scalar context
            Thanks to Adrian Howard for the suggestion.
        Added "rename" method.
        Overloaded stringification as a debugging aid.

0.11    2005-10-14
        Added "default" method.
        Added "get_pairs" method.
        Added "first" and "last" methods.
        Included test libs.
        Renamed t/10-basic.t to t/10-hash.t.

0.10    2005-10-12
        Added "array-like" methods.
        Updated docs and split tests into hash and array tests.

0.02    2005-10-12
        Overloaded boolean context so an empty array object returns false.
        Deleting a single key in scalar context now returns the value.
        Added clone() method.
        Fixed bug where setting a false value with insert_(before|after)
        would corrupt internal indices.
        Updated docs and tests.

0.01    2005-10-10
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
