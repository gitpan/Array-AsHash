Revision history for Array-AsHash

0.02    2005-10-12
        Overloaded boolean context so an empty array object returns false.
        Deleting a single key in scalar context now returns the value.
        Added clone() method.
        Fixed bug where setting a false value with insert_(before|after)
        would corrupt internal indices.
        Updated docs and tests.

0.01    2005-10-10
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
